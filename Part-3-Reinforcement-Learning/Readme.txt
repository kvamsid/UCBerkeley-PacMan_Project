In this phase of my project, I focused on value iterations, policy iterations, and Q-learning algorithms. Value iterations involved implementing various policies to drive Pac-Man's movement and refining them through policy iterations to attain the optimal policy. In Q-learning, I pursued policy-less iterations to determine the best course of action based on Q-values, enabling Pac-Man to navigate the environment effectively.
